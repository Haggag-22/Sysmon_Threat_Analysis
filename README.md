# Monitoring Malicious Activities with Sysmon

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing event logs generated by Sysmon to detect potential malicious activities within a Windows environment. I explored various techniques, including DLL hijacking, unmanaged PowerShell execution, and LSASS dumps, to identify suspicious behavior in system processes. By filtering event codes and examining log entries, I aimed to differentiate between legitimate user actions and potential threats. **You can check the repository for the logs and download them yourselves**.

## Key Objectives

- Identify and analyze processes involved in DLL hijacking.
- Investigate unmanaged PowerShell code execution.
- Examine processes that perform LSASS dumps and subsequent logins.

## Findings

Throughout the project, I documented my findings and conclusions based on the analysis of multiple event logs, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the security implications of the observed activities.
